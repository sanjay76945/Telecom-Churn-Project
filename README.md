# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry by analyzing customer usage data. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression modeling, we identified key churn indicators among high-value customers. The model helps the telecom company proactively manage churn, retain valuable customers, and minimize revenue loss through targeted retention strategies and data-driven decision-making.
